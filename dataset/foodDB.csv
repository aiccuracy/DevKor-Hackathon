The tuna used is usually pre-cooked, canned, and packaged in water or oil.[1] Pickles, celery, relish, and onion[1] are foremost among the ingredients that are often added. When the mixture is placed on bread, it makes a tuna salad sandwich.[1] Tuna salad is also regularly served by itself, or on top of crackers, lettuce, tomato, or avocado. Chopped boiled eggs may be added. Relish adds a piquant flavor yet, unlike commonly added vegetables, requires no chopping."
